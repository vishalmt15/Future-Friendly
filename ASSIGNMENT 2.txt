1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
    In Excel, a dollar sign can denote a currency format. A dollar sign in Excel is used for absolute cell referencing.


2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
    Spreadsheet formulas are defaulted as a relative cell reference. When a formula in a cell is copied to another cell, it changes to match the new cell. 
    In some situations, you may need to have the formula stay the same and not change, which is known as an absolute cell reference.
    Changing a cell from a relative to an absolute reference can be done by following the steps below.
    * Open Microsoft Excel.
    * Highlight the cell containing the formula you want to have changed to an absolute or relative reference.
    * Click the formula box (shown below) or highlight the formula and press the F4 key to switch between an absolute and relative cell reference.


3. Explain the order of operations in excel?
    When evaluating a formula, Excel follows a standard math protocol called "order of operations". 
     In general, Excel's order of operation follows the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) 
     but with some customization to handle the formula syntax in a spreadsheet.


4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax for any of two?
    * SUM Function:- The sum function is the most used function when it comes to computing data on Excel.
    * TEXT Function. 
    * VLOOKUP Function. 
    * AVERAGE Function. 
    * CONCATENATE Function.
     
     Basi Syntax Of Sum Function:-
      1.    =SUM(RANGE)
             
            Eg: SUM(RANGE1,RANGE2)
   
      2.  =Text(Value, format_text)

           Eg: TEXT(A1, "d mmmm yy")


5. When would you use the subtotal function?
    The SUBTOTAL function is used when you display a Total row in an Excel Table. 
    Excel inserts the SUBTOTAL function automatically, and you can use a drop-down menu to switch behavior and show max, min, average, etc.

6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
    Syntax Of Vlookup Function:
    VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num,[range_lookup]).
     
     * lookup_value: Lookup_value is the first parameter of excel Vlookup formula . 
        lookup_value is a required parameter in Vlookup function in excel . 
        Lookup value is a value which user wants to search in the first column of a range array and wants the respective row values to be returned. 
        If excel finds lookup value in the table array it will return the respective row value of the given column in the range. Otherwise it will return #N/A error.

     * table_array: Table_array is the second parameter of excel Vlookup formula. 
        table_array is a required parameter in Vlookup function in excel. table_array is a range in Excel worksheet which user wants to search the lookup value in the first column of this table array.
        Vlookup function is not a case sensitive.

    * col_index_num: col_index_num is the third parameter of excel Vlookup formula. 
       col_index_num is a required parameter in Vlookup function in excel.
       We need to mention column index number in the Vlookup formula to tell Excel from which column of the given array to be picked a row value of the lookup value. 
       Column index number should be always greater than equals to 1 and less than or equals to number of columns in the given table array range. 
       If you specify less than 1, Vlookup formula returns #VALUE error value. And if you mention a column number which is greater than number of columns in the lookup table array range, vlookup formula returns #Ref error value.

    * range lookup: range_lookup is the fourth parameter of excel formula. range_lookup is an optional parameter in Vlookup function in Excel. Range lookup parameter is to specify whether user required an exact match values or an approximate match values. 
       If you omit this parameter, Vlookup function treat it as TRUE as default. You can mention TRUE (or 1) or FALSE (or 0) as a range lookup. Here TRUE searches for the exact match and returns the respective row values if match founds. 
       Otherwise Vlookup returns approximate row values of the given lookup value. I.e. less than the exact match. Here TRUE and FALSE are Boolean values.
       FALSE returns the Exact matched row values. If lookup value not found in the first column of the table array, vlookup function returns #N/A error value.
